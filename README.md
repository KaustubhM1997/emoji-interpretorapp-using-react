# Emoji Interpreter
I'm sure most of us have had a hard time interpreting what an emoji means on the internet. This React app created in Codesandbox would help interpret those emojis for you.

### How does the app work?
Users need to put their emoji in the input field and as soon as they do that, its meaning would be displayed below the input box. The app also displays some of the emojis whose meaning the user can find out by clicking on the emoji.

The app also takes care of edge cases wherein a user might input an emoji that's not in our database. To learn more, check out the app now!
